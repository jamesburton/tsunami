"""Current — semantic tension measurement.

Measures the coherence of a response by probing the model's own
confidence. Truth forms tight knots (low tension). Hallucination
forms loose tangles (high tension).

The current doesn't move the water. It measures which way it's flowing.

Based on the Wilson Loop / TuningFork from mind_proton:
- Generate response
- Probe alignment against truth anchors and drift markers
- Return tension score (0.0 = grounded, 1.0 = hallucinating)
- If tension high, iteratively correct by re-asking with focus
